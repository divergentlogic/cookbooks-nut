# MONITOR <system> <powervalue> <username> <password> ("master"|"slave")
#
# List systems you want to monitor.  Not all of these may supply power
# to the system running upsmon, but if you want to watch it, it has to
# be in this section.
#
# You must have at least one of these declared.
#
# <system> is a UPS identifier in the form <upsname>@<hostname>[:<port>]
# like ups@localhost, su700@mybox, etc.
#
# Examples:
#
#  - "su700@mybox" means a UPS called "su700" on a system called "mybox"
#
#  - "fenton@bigbox:5678" is a UPS called "fenton" on a system called
#    "bigbox" which runs upsd on port "5678".
#
# The UPS names like "su700" and "fenton" are set in your ups.conf
# in [brackets] which identify a section for a particular driver.
#
# If the ups.conf on host "doghouse" has a section called "snoopy", the
# identifier for it would be "snoopy@doghouse".
#
# <powervalue> is an integer - the number of power supplies that this UPS
# feeds on this system.  Most computers only have one power supply, so this
# is normally set to 1.  You need a pretty big or special box to have any
# other value here.
#
# You can also set this to 0 for a system that doesn't supply any power,
# but you still want to monitor.  Use this when you want to hear about
# changes for a given UPS without shutting down when it goes critical,
# unless <powervalue> is 0.
#
# <username> and <password> must match an entry in that system's
# upsd.users.  If your username is "monmaster" and your password is
# "blah", the upsd.users would look like this:
#
#	[monmaster]
#		password  = blah
#		upsmon master 	(or slave)
#
# "master" means this system will shutdown last, allowing the slaves
# time to shutdown first.
#
# "slave" means this system shuts down immediately when power goes critical.
#
# Examples:
#
# MONITOR myups@bigserver 1 monmaster blah master
# MONITOR su700@server.example.com 1 upsmon secretpass slave
# MONITOR myups@localhost 1 upsmon pass master	(or slave)

#   
#   # <powervalue> is an integer - the number of power supplies that this UPS
#   # feeds on this system.  Most computers only have one power supply, so this
#   # is normally set to 1.  You need a pretty big or special box to have any
#   # other value here.
#   #
#   # You can also set this to 0 for a system that doesn't supply any power,

# Give the number of power supplies that must be receiving power to keep
# this system running.  Most systems have one power supply, so you would
# put "1" in this field.
#
# Large/expensive server type systems usually have more, and can run with
# a few missing.  The HP NetServer LH4 can run with 2 out of 4, for example,
# so you'd set that to 2.  The idea is to keep the box running as long
# as possible, right?
#
# Obviously you have to put the redundant supplies on different UPS circuits
# for this to make sense!  See big-servers.txt in the docs subdirectory
# for more information and ideas on how to use this feature.

# whatever caused this event to happen.
#
# Note that this is only called for NOTIFY events that have EXEC set with
# NOTIFYFLAG.  See NOTIFYFLAG below for more details.
#
# Making this some sort of shell script might not be a bad idea.  For more

# Polling frequency in seconds while UPS on battery.
#
# You can make this number lower than POLLFREQ, which will make updates
# faster when any UPS is running on battery.  This is a good way to tune
# network load if you have a lot of these things running.
#
# The default is 5 seconds for both this and POLLFREQ.
default['nut']['poll_frequency_alert'] = 5

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOSTSYNC - How long upsmon will wait before giving up on another upsmon
#
# The master upsmon process uses this number when waiting for slaves to
# disconnect once it has set the forced shutdown (FSD) flag.  If they
# don't disconnect after this many seconds, it goes on without them.
#
# Similarly, upsmon slave processes wait up to this interval for the
# master upsmon to set FSD when a UPS they are monitoring goes critical -
# that is, on battery and low battery.  If the master doesn't do its job,
# the slaves will shut down anyway to avoid damage to the file systems.
#
# This "wait for FSD" is done to avoid races where the status changes
# to critical and back between polls by the master.
default['nut']['host_sync'] = 15

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DEADTIME - Interval to wait before declaring a stale ups "dead"
#
# upsmon requires a UPS to provide status information every few seconds
# (see POLLFREQ and POLLFREQALERT) to keep things updated.  If the status
# fetch fails, the UPS is marked stale.  If it stays stale for more than
# DEADTIME seconds, the UPS is marked dead.
#
# A dead UPS that was last known to be on battery is assumed to have gone
# to a low battery condition.  This may force a shutdown if it is providing
# a critical amount of power to your system.
#
# Note: DEADTIME should be a multiple of POLLFREQ and POLLFREQALERT.
# Otherwise you'll have "dead" UPSes simply because upsmon isn't polling
# them quickly enough.  Rule of thumb: take the larger of the two
# POLLFREQ values, and multiply by 3.
default['nut']['deadtime'] = 15

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# POWERDOWNFLAG - Flag file for forcing UPS shutdown on the master system
#
# upsmon will create a file with this name in master mode when it's time
# to shut down the load.  You should check for this file's existence in
# your shutdown scripts and run 'upsdrvctl shutdown' if it exists.
#
# See the shutdown.txt file in the docs subdirectory for more information.

# RBWARNTIME - replace battery warning time in seconds

# On a master, upsmon will wait this long after sending the NOTIFY_SHUTDOWN
# before executing your SHUTDOWNCMD.  If you need to do something in between
# those events, increase this number.  Remember, at this point your UPS is
# almost depleted, so don't make this too high.
#
# Alternatively, you can set this very low so you don't wait around when
# it's time to shut down.  Some UPSes don't give much warning for low
# battery and will require a value of 0 here for a safe shutdown.
#
# Note: If FINALDELAY on the slave is greater than HOSTSYNC on the master,
# the master will give up waiting for the slave to disconnect.

# MAXAGE 15
#

# the data for this many seconds, upsd marks it stale and stops making
# that information available to clients.  After all, the only thing worse
# than no data is bad data.
#
# You should only use this if your driver has difficulties keeping
# the data fresh within the normal 15 second interval.  Watch the syslog
